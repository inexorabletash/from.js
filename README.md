# from(js).select(awesome)

This gives JavaScript iterators capabilities similar to those in
.NET's [System.Linq](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq(v=vs.111).aspx)
extensions for enumerable types. A few examples:

```js
from(people).join(pets, o=>o.id, p=>p.owner_id, (o,p)=>o.name + ' â™¥ ' + p.name);
from(employees).where(e=>e.salary > 50000).select(e.name);
from(points).orderBy(p=>p.x).thenBy(p=>p.y).select(...);
from(employees).select(e.salary).sum();
```

Note that this is _not_ [LINQ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397926.aspx)
("Language-Integrated Query") which adds _syntax_ to languages like C#,
so you can write code like `from r in data where r.b select r.b`. No new syntax here.

### Basic usage
Call the global `from()` function with an _iterable_ (array, generator, etc) to
get an _enumerable_ which wraps the _iterable_ and exposes several new methods.
Those methods may return a simple value or another _enumerable_ for chained operation. An _enumerable_ is itself an _iterable_ so it can be traversed with `for..of` syntax
or converted to an array using `Array.from()`.

Some methods return an _ordered enumerable_ which has additional methods for
specifying a secondary (etc) ordering.

Methods are lazy where possible, meaning the traversal of the underlying iterator and any evaluation is deferred, for efficiency.

### Advanced usage
Some methods take an optional _comparer_ which is a function for comparing two
arguments; these come in two different flavors. An _equality comparer_ must return `true` if the two arguments are considered equal, and `false` otherwise. An _order comparer_ must return a number; negative if the first argument is greater than the second argument, a positive if the first argument is less than the second argument, or `0` otherwise.
The default _equality comparer_ is equivalent to `Object.is()`. The default
_order comparer_ is equivalent to `(a, b) => (a < b) ? -1 : (b < a) ? 1 : 0`

For complex operations like `groupBy` and `join`, the use of a custom comparer will dramatically slow down the operation. A comparer that does not properly reflect identity (i.e. `a === a`) will result in undefined behavior.


### Requirements
ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) - support for:
* iterators: `for..of` and `Symbol.iterator`
* generators: `function*(){ ... yield ... }`
* arrow functions: `(a, b) => a + b`
* `let`
* `Map`, `Set`
* `Array.from`

It could be transpiled down to ES5, but you'd probably want to write the
application code using ES6isms anyway. (So transpile that too.)
